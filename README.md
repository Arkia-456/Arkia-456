# Hi there 👋

<h2 align="center">💻 I'm Aurore, a full-stack developer</h2>
I'm Aurore, a passionate (mostly) self-taught full-stack developer from Strasbourg, France.
My passion for code comes from finding solutions to problems and helping people with these solutions.

<h2 align="center">🔎 About me</h2>

I have been working for nearly 3 years as a QSE (Quality, Safety & Environment) animator in industry.
In 2020, I chose to learn web development. Some courses here and there, I found out that I love coding all day long. Maybe because I love to solve problems, find innovative solutions and help people.
I learnt HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, deepened my JavaScript/TypeScript skills with Node.js, Express, Socket.io, Vue.js, discord.js and FoundryVTT.
I practiced on several projects:
- instant messaging app during my intership at Ichtus IT, with Node.js, socket.io and Vue.js (this one is private)
- Discord bot (❤️ baby [Blanco](https://github.com/Arkia-456/DiscordBot/tree/cooking)) for me and my friends, with Node.js and discord.js
- custom system for a VTT RPG on FoundryVTT, implementation of my husband's universe: [Madness](https://github.com/Arkia-456/madness/tree/develop)

Let's put the work aside, I'm a gamer. I mean, I love video games. RPG, J-RPG, adventure, action games in particular are my favorites. Otherwise, I like to felt some wool, play board games and tabletop RPGs.

<h2 align="center">📅 And now?</h2>
I work on my personal projects on my free time. I want to deepen my skills in TypeScript, Node.js and learn new concepts like DDD, TDD, craftsmanship.
For now, I'm fully invested in Madness' RPG, starting our first sessions before the end of the year.
